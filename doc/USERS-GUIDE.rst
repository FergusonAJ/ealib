System Requirements
-------------------
EALib is heavily dependent on a number of `Boost <http://www.boost.org>`_ libraries.  You'll need Boost 1.47.0 or better.  **Warning:** Most (all?) of the common package management systems install Boost incorrectly.  Instructions for installing Boost 1.47.0 can be found at `Installing Boost`_, but the most current instructions are always found in the "Getting Started" guide `here <http://www.boost.org>`_.  EALib uses bjam for command-line builds (no Makefiles), so be sure to install Boost.Build (unless you don't need command line builds).
