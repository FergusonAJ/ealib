<h1>EALib Installation Guide</h1>

<h2>Conventions</h2>

<p>Text <code>like this</code> refers to something that is case &amp; punctuation specific, for example, a path like <code>/usr/local</code>.  </p>

<p>When something needs to be executed in a terminal, it will look <code>% like this</code>.  Note the preceding <code>%</code>-sign.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>You need a working development environment.  On OS X, this is Xcode, which can be downloaded from the App Store.  On Ubuntu, this can be done by:</p>

<pre><code>% sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Decide where you are going to install the Boost libraries.  This is called the prefix.  The default prefix on Unix-like systems is <code>/usr/local</code>.  If you don't have root permissions on your system, you will need to use your home directory as the prefix.  In the rest of this document, wherever you see <em>prefix</em>, either: omit it if you are using the default, or replace it with your home directory.  For example, <code>% ./bootstrap --prefix=prefix</code> means execute <code>./bootstrap.sh</code> in a terminal if you are using the default location, or execute <code>./bootstrap.sh --prefix=${HOME}</code> in a terminal if you are using your home directory.  Note that <code>${HOME}</code> is shorthand for your home directory on Unix-like systems.  </p></li>
<li><p>If you are installing to /usr/local, you'll need to have root permissions.  In the directions that follow, wherever you see sudo, if you are NOT installing to /usr/local, you should NOT include the sudo command.  E.g., if you are installing to your home directory and you see <code>% sudo ./b2 install</code>, you should execute "./b2 install" instead of "sudo ./b2 install".</p></li>
<li><p>Install zlib.  This <em>should</em> be installed by default, but you might have to go get it from MacPorts (OS X) or other platform-specific package repository.  If you're not sure if it's installed, check /usr/lib, /opt/local/lib, and /usr/local/lib for libz.* (your system is not likely to have all these directories present; that's ok).</p></li>
</ul>
