/*! Common main function for most evolutionary algorithms supported by EALib.
 
 This is more of a convenience than anything else - EALib is a header-only library,
 and is most likely to be used within existing code (i.e., something that already has
 a main() and configuration framework).  As such, it's reasonable to de-couple the
 runner from the EA.
