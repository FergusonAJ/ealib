    // **** Warning: this is not yet well-developed.

    /* The idea here is that some kinds of EAs require that an individual's genotype
     be converted to another form prior to fitness evaluation.  This is usually
     referred to as the "encoding type."
     
     Here we define three different encoding types: direct, indirect, and generative:
     */
    
    //! Indicates that the individual's genotype directly encodes the phenotype.
    struct directS { };
    
    /*! Indicates that the individaul's genotype indirectly encodes the phenotype
     (i.e., must be translated or generated prior to fitness evaluation).
     */
    struct indirectS { };
    
    /* These difference encoding types are used when make_phenotype() is called
     on an individual.  Note that the default is directS.
     
     To be clear about definitions:
     
     Genotype: That which makes up the genetic component of an individual; inherited.
     In EALib, genotypes == representation.
     
     Phenotype: That component of an individual that is evaluated by the fitness
     function; can be the genotype (direct), an object that was translated
     from the genotype (indirect), or even an object that was generated
     (generative).
