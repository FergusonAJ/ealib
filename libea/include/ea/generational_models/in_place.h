         This generational model doesn't, in fact, produce new generations.  Rather,
         it applies mutations to all individuals in the population.  This effectively
         turns the population into a "superorganism."
         
         Note that the individual mutation rates should be probably be reduced
         accordingly.
         
         Parent and survivor selection strategies are used to handle the case of a
         population that should grow or shrink, respectively.
