		 This generational model defines the traditional genetic algorithm
		 crossover/mutate/select loop~\cite{eiben2007introduction}.
		 
		 Parents are selected from the current population and recombined to produce
		 offspring.  Some of the resulting offspring are then mutated.  Finally,
		 individuals from the joint population of parents and offspring are selected
		 for inclusion in the next generation.
         
         \param lambda is the number of offspring during 1 update (~"generation").
