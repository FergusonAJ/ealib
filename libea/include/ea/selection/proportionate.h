         This strategy selects individuals proportionately by some attribute,
         usually fitness.
         
         Note: There is a member variable here called "offset," whose purpose is
         to offset the selection attribute when the sum of that attribute is 0.0.
         For example, if all fitnesses in the population are 0.0, then FPS normally
         breaks (divide by zero).  The offset prevents users of proportionate selection
         from having to deal with this.
