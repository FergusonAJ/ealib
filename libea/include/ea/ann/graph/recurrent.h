		 Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a slightly different beast than feed-forward
		 neural networks in that activations proceed according to the following function:
		 y_i(t) = f_i(net_i(t-1)),
		 that is, the activation (output) at time t of any given neuron in the network depends
		 on its inputs from time t-1.  Thus, activations proceed along edges, and asymmetries in
		 the network serve as delays.
		 
		 The activation of a neuron then proceeds as follows:
		 - apply inputs
		 - for each neuron n:
		 activation = 0
		 for each incoming edge e:
		 activation += w(e) * e(t-1)
		 e(t-1) = e(t)
		 activation = sigmoid(activation)
		 for each outgoing edge e:
		 e(t) = activation
		 
		 The end result here is that we have different methods of evaluation for different neural
		 network structures.  This is fine; just have to be careful when we start comparing between
		 them.  With feed-forward networks, each evaluation is a complete input->output strobe,
		 while with recurrent networks it's an update on each neuron.
		 
		 A consequence of RNN activation is that the time slice for each update must be smaller
		 that that for feed-forward networks in order for the outputs to correlate to the inputs
		 in a reasonable amount of time.  Since evaluation of a feed-forward network is complete
		 (input signals propagate entirely to outputs), in RNNs input signals only propagate a
		 single layer.
