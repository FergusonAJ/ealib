** These instructions are current as of 7/22/2014 **

There are Three different sets of instructions for installing Boost here: HPCC (quick way), HPCC (self-built), and OS X.

**After** you've installed Boost, get a copy of the latest EALib and Avida4 sample project:

    git clone https://github.com/dknoester/ealib.git ealib
    git clone https://github.com/dknoester/avida4.git avida4

To make sure everything's working:

    cd ealib
    bjam
    cd ../avida4
    bjam

A sample run (from avida4/):

    ./bin/clang-darwin-4.2.1/debug/link-static/avida-logic9 -c ./etc/logic9.cfg --verbose


========
MSU HPCC (QUICK WAY):
========

Put these:
    export BOOST_BUILD_PATH=/mnt/home/dk/share/boost-build
    export PATH=$PATH:/mnt/home/dk/bin

... in your ~/.bashrc (or other shell startup script).  That should do it.


========
MSU HPCC (ROLL YOUR OWN, AT YOUR OWN RISK, INSTALLS IN YOUR HOME DIR): 
========

Make sure that your path includes ${HOME}/bin, e.g., put this:
    export PATH=$PATH:${HOME}/bin
... in your ~/.bashrc (or other shell startup script).

Download boost (current rls == 1.55):
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/boost_1_55_0.tar.gz
    tar -xzf boost_1_55_0.tar.gz
    cd boost_1_55_0

Build bjam:
    cd tools/build/v2
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./b2 install --prefix=${HOME}

Site config:
    vi ~/share/boost-build/site-config.jam
>>>
using gcc : : : <compileflags>-ftemplate-depth-255 ;
import os ;
local HOME = [ os.environ HOME ] ;
local INC = $(HOME)/include ;
local LIB = $(HOME)/lib ;
local SYS = /usr/lib64 ;

import boost ;
using boost : 1.55 :
    <include>$(INC)
    <library>$(LIB)
    <layout>system
    ;
boost.use-project 1.55 ;

project site-config : requirements <include>$(INC) ;
lib z : : <link>shared <name>z <search>$(SYS) ;
>>>

Copy boost.jam:
    cp contrib/boost.jam ~/share/boost-build/

Set the boost build root; add this:
    export BOOST_BUILD_PATH=$HOME/share/boost-build
... to your ~/.bashrc (or other shell startup script).

Build boost:
    (back in boost_1_55_0/)
    ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=${HOME}
    ./b2
    ./b2 install

That should be it...


========
OS X
========

These instructions install Boost to /usr/local.  Make sure that /usr/local/bin is on your path.  If you don't install Boost there, you'll have trouble with XCode.  Also, these instructions do not install all of Boost; some libraries are left out due to trouble with the latest clang.

Download boost (current rls == 1.55):
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/boost_1_55_0.tar.gz
    tar -xzf boost_1_55_0.tar.gz
    cd boost_1_55_0

Build bjam:
    cd tools/build/v2
    ./bootstrap.sh --with-toolset=clang
    sudo ./b2 install --toolset=clang

Copy boost.jam:
    sudo cp contrib/boost.jam /usr/local/share/boost-build/build/

Site config (/usr/local/share/boost-build/site-config.jam):
    using clang ;
    import boost ;
    boost.use-project ;
    project site-config ;
    lib z ;

Put this in your ~/.bashrc:
    export BOOST_BUILD_PATH=/usr/local/share/boost-build

Build boost:
    (back in boost_1_55_0/)
    ./bootstrap.sh --with-toolset=clang --with-libraries=filesystem,iostreams,program_options,regex,serialization,system,test,timer
    ./b2

STOP.  Look at the "Performing configuration checks" output.  Make sure that zlib is "yes."  If not, go install it (e.g., from MacPorts: zlib 1.2.8_0).  Delete the bin.v2 directory and go back to the bootstrap step above.  Then...

    sudo ./b2 install
